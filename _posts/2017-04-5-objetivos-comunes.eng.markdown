- 1- Give the participants different signs with the “Facebook post” image.

- 2- Ask them to describe some important goal or event and to assign a date when it should have been achieved.

- 3- Order the “Facebook posts” according to the estimated date of achievement.

- 4- Give each participant 3 “Like” signs.

- 5- Ask participants to assign their “Likes” to the most priority goals. A participant cannot assign all their “Likes” to the same publication.

- 6- Count the “Likes” assigned to each goal in order to identify the goal with the highest priority.

- 7- Initiate a debate on what actions to take to ensure compliance with the goals within the deadlines. Write these actions on sticky notes and stick them under each post.

- 8- Save a photo of the result and share it with all participants.
