- 1- Create a 3-column table:

	- <b>a.</b> Who?

	- <b>b.</b> What?

	- <b>c.</b> When?

- 2- Ask the participants to write on sticky notes the tasks to be carried out during the next working period.

- 3- Stick each note in the “What?” column, so that each note is a row in the table.

- 4- Choose a note. Initiate a debate to decide among all the participants to whom to assign the task. This choice may take into account factors such as experience, capabilities, etc. Write the chosen member(s) in a new sticky note and stick it in the same row, in the “Who?” column.

- 5- Follow the discussion with the aim of agreeing the maximum date for the completion of the task. Write this date on a new sticky note and stick it in the same row, in the “When?” column.

- 6- Save a photo of the resulting table and share it with all participants.
