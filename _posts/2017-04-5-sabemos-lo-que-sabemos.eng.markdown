- 1- Start a brainstorming to get a list of all the knowledge and/or skills that a team like yours should have. Write each knowledge on a sticky note.

- 2- Draw a matrix with the following 4 quadrants:
	
	- <b>a.</b> We know we know. The team is sure that it has the needed knowledge.

	- <b>b.</b> We did not know that we know. The team was not aware that it possesses the needed knowledge.

	- <b>c.</b> We did not know that we do not know. The team was not aware that it does not possess the needed knowledge.

	- <b>d.</b> We know we do not know. The team is clear that it does not have the needed knowledge.

- 3- For each note, ask the question: What is the reality in our team? Place each note in the quadrant agreed by all participants.

- 4- Start a discussion about the items in the quadrant “We know we know” and the importance of moving all the important knowledge to this quadrant.

- 5- Identify which of the notes of the remaining 3 quadrants should be moved:

	- <b>a.</b> From “We did not know we know” to “We know we know”.

	- <b>b.</b> From “We did not know we do not know” to “We know we do not know”.

	- <b>c.</b> From “We know we do not know” to “We know we know”.

- 6- Write on sticky notes of a different colour those actions to be implemented in order to improve the team knowledge.

- 7- Save a photo of the resulting matrix and share it with all participants.
