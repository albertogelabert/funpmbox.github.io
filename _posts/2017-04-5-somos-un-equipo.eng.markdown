- 1- Start a brainstorming to get a list of aspects that define the team, based on teamâ€™s characteristics and activities carried out by team members.

- 2- Draw a matrix with the following 4 quadrants:

	- &bull; The team is.

	- &bull; The team is not.

	- &bull; The team does.

	- &bull; The team does not.

- 3- Ask members to write each aspect on a sticky note. These aspects can be both positive and negative.

- 4- Ask them to stick each note into the corresponding quadrant.

- 5- Group notes with similar content.

- 6- Read each of the notes (or groups of similar notes) and check that there is a consensus on the correct location of the note. Move the note from one quadrant to another if the team changes their mind after the debate.

- 7- Save a photo of the resulting matrix and share it with all participants.
