- 1- Draw or create with the tape a matrix, in which:

	- <b>a.</b> The horizontal axis represents the degree of planning.

	- <b>b.</b> The vertical axis represents the degree of success.

	- In this way, 4 different quadrants are obtained:

	- a. “Planned and satisfactory”: It will contain those aspects that were planned and have worked out well.

	- b. “Planned and failed”: It will contain those aspects that were planned and have not worked out well.

	- c. “Unplanned and failed”: It will contain those aspects that were not planned and have not worked out well.

	- d. “Unplanned and satisfactory”: It will contain those aspects that were not planned and have worked out well.

- 2- Ask the participants to write on sticky notes all those events that have occurred in the project. Use notes of one colour for positive facts and notes of another colour for negatives. Ask them to place each note in the quadrant where it fits best.

- 3- Start a discussion on the notes in the matrix. Write the lessons learned in sticky notes of a different colour to the previous ones.

- 4- Save a photo of the resulting matrix and share it with all participants.
