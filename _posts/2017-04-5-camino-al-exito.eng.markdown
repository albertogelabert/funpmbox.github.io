- 1- Place the sign with the image of the “car” on the board. To its left, place the sign with the image of the “parachute” and to its right, the sign with the image of the “bridge”.

- 2- Ask participants to write on sticky notes the answers to the following questions:

	- <b>a.</b> What has slowed you down?

	- <b>b.</b> What has encouraged you to move forward?

	- <b>c.</b> What are the risks that may arise in the close future?

	- <b>d.</b> What can we do to minimize those risks?

- 3- Ask them to stick the notes in the corresponding place, taking into account that:

	- <b>a.</b> The parachute brakes the car,

	- <b>b.</b> The car tries to move forward,

	- <b>c.</b> The risks are the precipice and

	- <b>d.</b> The solutions from the bridge.

- 4- Initiate a debate to analyse the results obtained.

- 5- Save a photo of the resulting image and share it with all participants.
