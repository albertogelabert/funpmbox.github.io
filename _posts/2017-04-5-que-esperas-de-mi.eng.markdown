- 1- Identify all the roles representing activities of all team members.

- 2- Create a matrix with as many columns and rows as identified roles.

	- &bull; The vertical axis will be called “From”.

	- &bull; The horizontal axis will be called “To”.

- 3- Ask participants to write on sticky notes their expectations about the different team profiles. Ask them to stick the notes in the “From” row corresponding to their own role and in the column that their expectations are addressed “To”.

- 4- Choose a role. Ask to read loud the notes in his/her row. Start a discussion with the rest of the roles involved.

- 5- Repeat the previous step for all the roles in the matrix.

- 6- Save a photo of the resulting matrix and share it with all participants.

You can also describe the self-expectations of each role in the project. In that case, each role must use the cells in which the name of the role on the “From” and “To” axes coincide.
