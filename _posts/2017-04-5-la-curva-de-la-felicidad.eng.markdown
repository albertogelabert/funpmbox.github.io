- 1- Draw the two axes of the graph:
	
	- <b>a.</b> The horizontal axis will represent the working period to be analysed. Milestones can be added to make the work period clearer.

	- <b>b.</b> The vertical axis will be the gradient of “happiness” or motivation during the course of the work period. Place the signs with the faces of happiness on this axis.

	- <b>Note</b>: This game can be played using other gradients on the vertical axis.

- 2- Invite each participant to draw the curve that reflects their level of happiness or motivation during the course of the period.

- 3- Initiate a debate on the curves obtained. Start with the time periods with the lowest levels of happiness or motivation.

- 4- Ask participants to indicate the reasons for these low values. Write on sticky notes the problems identified and stick them to correspond to the exact period of time in which they took place.

- 5- Start a new debate to find possible solutions to the problems identified. Write these solutions on sticky notes of a different colour and stick them over the notes with the problem to be solved.

- 6- Save a photo of the resulting graph and share it with all participants.
