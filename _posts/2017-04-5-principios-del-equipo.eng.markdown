- 1- Decide, together with all the team members which categories of the team principles will be interesting to be discussed and defined. For example, “Meetings”, “Roles of each member”, “Communication channels”, etc.

- 2- Distribute on the table as many signs with the image of “Box” as agreed categories. Indicate the name of each category on each “Box”.

- 3- Encourage participants to write, for the different categories, on sticky notes:

	- &bull; the principles to be fostered (in one colour) and

	- &bull; the principles to be avoided (in another colour).

- 4- Define common grounds and agree with all the participants on the principles obtained for each category.

- 5- Save a photo of the result and share it with all participants.
